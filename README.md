# OCR Graduation Project

# This is an OCR AI that can extract text from an image or PDF and convert it to editable sentences or paragraphs. There are a lot of features that can be used on the extracted text, including translation or summarization.

# How to use it:
# You can either access the Google Colab link or download the Python Code for a Discord Bot.

# Using Google Colab: simply click the link and you can launch and use the code exactly as it is in Colab.

# Using the Code: this will be a Discord Bot, so please change the token into your own bot token, then feel free to use it with the commands available
